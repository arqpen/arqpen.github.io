Usage
-----

Using the graphical library is really simple, just copy the provided source code to:
The idea is that you avoid downloading to your computer, thus generating junk files that we will never look for again. That's why the tte tool allows you to copy to the clipboard and add directly to your editing software like Adobe Illustrator.
We want it to allow us to be compatible with:

* Svg File  `Source code`.
* Adobe Illustrator  `Copy and paste`.
* Adobe Photoshop `Copy and paste`.
* AutoCAD `Copy and paste`.

We are testing the different ways to export to multiple platforms in a light way.
